		<p style="padding-top:10px;">
            Anyone who knows me knows that I love physics. The exactness about it, the intricacy. Take the simple example of a speeding car trying to stop before it hits another car some distance in front of it; 
			what is the minimum distance the speeding car must be from the second car before applying the brakes without hitting it? Alternatively, if the braking distance between the two cars is known a priori, what
			is the maximum speed the first car can achieve before it will be unable to stop without colliding with the second car? Just a basic understanding of physics and math allows us to answer these
			questions fairly easily.

            Personally, I like light. I mean, I really, really, like light. When I used to tell people that I studied light in university, most wondered how the heck a university program can be about light (in truth,
			there was much more than light, but it's still not a stretch to tell people that.)! But light is an extremely vast and important topic - for example, it's what enables you to read the
			information on this page - and not just because you wouldn't be able to read in darkness! All of this text once started out as 1's and 0's stored in a computer before they were mysteriously <i>encoded</i> into
			light from a laser beam. The light from the laser beam was then shot down thousands of kilometres of optical fibre and then converted back into 1's and 0's somewhere else so that your computer could interpret
			and display the 1's and 0's as text again. Whoa, cool, right?

		<p style="padding-top:10px;">
            There are many different ways we can talk about light, and some are better than others depending on what aspect of light we want to talk about. The following image
			(which was inspired by Saleh & Teich's <i>Fundamentals of Photonics</i>) is useful to keep in mind:
            <img src="images/OpticalPyramid.png" style="margin:0 auto;display: block;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;height:300px; width:400px;">
			I call this the "optical theory pyramid". The optical pyramid summarizes the different theories of light and how we can talk about it, with the most fundamental and "correct" theories appearing
			at the base of the pyramid. Let's start at the top of the pyramid with <i>Ray Optics</i>. When most people talk about light, they talk about it in the context of 'rays' -- a collection of straight
			lines from the light source to the observer. This ray model is ancient and dates back thousands of years, but still remains relevant today, 
		</p>
		<p style="padding-top:10px;">
            The theory of <i>Wave Optics</i> is much newer relative to ray optics, and it dates back to around the time that Isaac Newton was alive. Here, the description of light as rays evolved into a more
			sophisticated description of light as waves, which allowed for quantitative discussions of phenomena such as diffraction and interference.
		</p>
		<p style="padding-top:10px;">
            It was in the nineteenth century that James Clerk Maxwell formalized <i>Electromagnetic Optics</i>, an evolution to the theory of wave optics. Here, the description of light as waves was formalized
            within the confines of vector calculus and augmented with properties known from electricty and magnetism. Electromagnetic optics describes light as a <i>vector field</i>, meaning that
			light has a magnitude and a direction defined at every point in space. Today, electromagnetic optics provides the most accurate and encompassing description of
			light within the limits of classical physics, that is, without incorporating quantum mechanics.
		</p>
		<p style="padding-top:10px;">
            The most base model with which one can currently describe optical phenomena is <i>Quantum Optics</i>. Here, Maxwell's electromagnetic field is <i>quantized</i>, that is, light is decribed by
            discrete entities known as photons rather than continuous fields. While the <i>notion</i> of a photon was introduced by Einstein as a 'quanta of light' in 1905, it wasn't until 1926 that the
            word photon was coined by chemist Gilbert Lewis. This description of light offers more than the electromagnetic field description as it is able to describe light-matter interactions.

		<h3 style="padding-top: 20px;font-size:1.0em;"><a name="Rays"><u>Ray Optics</u></a></h3>
		<p style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;">
            Ray optics, or geometrical optics, is one of the first things a student of optics will learn because it is the most intuitive.
			Ray optics is concerned with the position and momentum (direction) of light rays, and ray optics plays by a few rules:
			<ol style="padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;">
			  <li>Light travels in the form of rays (duh).</li>
			  <li>A substance through which light can propagate (i.e., an <i>optical medium</i>) is characterized by the quantity $n \geq 1$ known as the <b>refractive index</b>.
			      The refractive index is the ratio for how quickly light travels in vacuum (empty space) relative to the optical medium.</li>
		      <li>The <b>optical path length</b>, $OPL$, is defined as the product of the distance $d$ light travels through a medium and the refractive index $n$ of the medium, $ OPL = nd $.
			      If the refractive index is spatially variant throughout the optical medium, i.e., $n = n(x, y, z)$, then the optical path length takes a line integral form:
                  $$	OPL = 	\int_{\mathcal{C}} n(x,y,z) ds, $$		 where $ds$ is a differential line element along the curve $\mathcal{C}$. </li>
			  <li>The path that light takes through a medium is always the one that minimizes (and in some cases, maximizes) the time spent within the medium. This is known as <b>Fermat's Principle</b>.</li>
			</ol>
			With these postulates in hand, ray optics can be used to prove the Law of Reflection, Law of Refraction (Snell's Law), and many other 'laws' to do with imaging and lenses. In fact, ray optics
			is especially useful in determining how and where objects will appear when viewed with lenses and mirrors. I came across a cool app made from the folks at the University of Colorado at Boulder
			that demonstrates some basic modeling that can be done with ray optics and lens with respect to image formation. 
			If you open this app, make sure you check the boxes "Many Rays" on the left and "Virtual Image" on the right. You can also play with the 
			sliders that control the geometry of the lens.

            I have seen some even more interesting simulations with ray optics by <a href="http://www2.optics.rochester.edu/workgroups/alonso/Home.html" target="_blank">Miguel Alonso</a>
			from the University of Rochester.

		<p style="padding-top:10px;">
            Usually the physics about stopping cars or billiard balls is not enough to inspire interest in physics (though it was for me). Usually more <i>flashy</i> physics is required! To this end,
			I would refer people to read about special relativity, or the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. the <b>Twin Paradox</b> (if you don't want to see any math, just watch this
