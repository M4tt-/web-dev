		   The mind is nothing without the body, and the body is nothing without the mind.
		</p>
		<p style="padding-top:10px;">
		   One thing that I wish upon the world is a more wide spread emphasis on physical fitness. Health issues such as obesity, disease, chronic pain, or even just a plain physical inability
		   to take care of oneself (esp. the elderly) can often be prevented entirely through a life long commitment to fitness. It's a shame to see these sometimes young bodies begin to deteriorate
		   so early due to a sedentary lifestyle. People often use the excuse of not having enough time, which is complete garbage; I have worked my way through a B. Eng and M.Sc while raising my son
		   (and maintaining a healthy social life) and still dedicated a minimum of 1 hour per day to physical fitness. The excuse of not having time is a cop-out for utter laziness.
		</p>
		<p style="padding-top:10px;">
		   Disclaimer: I am absolutely not a certified personal trainer or strength and conditinioning coach. But I have, however, more than a decade of fitness experience across many domains. After taking a 
		   mandatory, resistance-training based fitness course in high school, I committed to a similar routine on my own accord at local gyms. I spent a year paying dues in a CrossFit gym (or 'box',
		   as it's referred to in the community), and have also had direct coaching in powerlifting from professional powerlifters (shout out to Jay Nera, if you ever see this!). I have practiced
		   yoga at local studios and on my own accord, I meditate, and I have ran 15km+ obstacle course races, one of which was up and down Mont Ste. Marie in Quebec, Canada (where I came 2nd in my heat).
		   I've also hurt myself in the gym and outside of it due to improper form.
		</p>
		<p style="padding-top:10px;">
		   What I seek to offer with this page is information for how you can take some steps towards a healthier physicality. For those who already value this and are working towards optimal health,
		   I also offer several gym routines.
